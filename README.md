# SYSTEM MONITOR APP

Used primarily for monitoring your PC's CPU/RAM in a simple way by just running the main.py file or converting it to an executable file.

## DEPENDENCIES
Actual dependencies are (I'll update them if I add more):
- Python 3 or later
- pip (pip install pip)
- tkinter (it should come with Python)
- psutil (pip install psutil)

## HOW TO USE

Download the .zip and extract the files or, I personally recommend to clone it (git clone https://github.com/elpapitaslays/sys-monitor.git in the terminal). Once you have the files, download the dependencies (check dependencies section for that). Then you've 2 options, first one is to execute the program from **main.py** (yes, from that file because if you don't it'll give an error) and the program should start. The second option is to download a library that makes this project a single executable file (I highly recommend pyinstaller, though it's cross-platform), and following the steps to have the executable file.
